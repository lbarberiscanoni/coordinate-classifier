#Purpose 

A classifier to differentiate tangible devices from each other. The specific devices are created by Dr. Ulmer and Alex, and they have multiple sensors in different locations from each other whch is how they can be identified. 

Instead of having approximations or strict parameters to figure out which device is on, we implemented a basic ML model to classify them.
